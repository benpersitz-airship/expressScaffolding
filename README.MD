Welcome to simple Express Scaffolding

Getting started is easy. 

Just make sure you have NPM and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed.

1) Navigate to the root of this directory in terminal and run npm install
2) run node index.js in the terminal
3) Navigate to localhost:3000/ in your browser and you will see HELLO WORLD
4) Make a POST request in postman to localhost:3000/1stwebhook. You can include a JSON body. You should see the JSON body printed out in your terminal window where you are running the server. You should also get a 200 response back from your API with a repsonse of {"message": "got your post request}
5) Congrats! Everything is working as it should. Go build cool stuff.
